I plan to select research on the relevance of wearable devices to emotions for this literature search exercise, ideally using critical design research.
Helen Newing's book chapter outlines several strategies for conducting a literature search.

Defining the research question: First, I need to define the research question. For example, "What is the relationship between wearables and emotions?" or "How can wearables be used to measure emotions?" Or "How do wearables and emotions interact?"

Identify keywords: Next, you should identify the keywords that will be used to search the relevant literature. Some keywords that may be relevant to the topic include "wearables", "emotions", "affective computing", "physiological signals ", "heart rate", and "critical design" ......
Selecting a search database: You should choose the database for which you want to search the relevant literature. Some databases that may be useful for this topic include PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar.

Searching: You can search once you have identified the keywords and selected the database. Use Boolean operators such as 'AND', 'OR' and 'NOT' to combine keywords and optimise search results. For example, search for "wearables and emotions" or "emotional computing and physiological signals".

Optimise your search: If you do not find enough relevant literature, you may need to optimise your search strategy. For example, try using different keywords or search terms, or expand the database being searched appropriately.

Synthesise your findings: Finally, all results should be synthesised into a coherent narrative or argument. Try to use the key themes and findings from the literature review to form your ideas and conclusions about the relationship between wearables and emotions.
