#Week16-Transhumanist Practice and Post-human Theory

About Victoria Modesta

I argue that Victoria Modesta's work is both transhumanist in practice and posthumanist in theory and that the state of being embodied by Victoria Modesta evolves in the chronology of her videos.

0:27-0:52 - Victoria Modesta sits in a chair, looking down condescendingly at the people who have made technological modifications for her, exemplifying the practicality of transhumanism's use of technology to empower humans to transcend their current limitations.

0:58-1:47 - "We're playing God and now's the time. We're limitless. We're not confined. It's our future." (Lyrics). 
Victoria Modesta's modified abilities are given the connotation of spiritual leadership and brainwashing of people through various media means, suggesting that this technology enhances human survival and prosperity, i.e., the only way for humanity to remain alive is to integrate technology into the human body. However, the story also features acts of willing self-harm to become a cyborg, which implicitly reveals the pitfalls facing transhumanism and critical thinking about applying technology to the human body.

1:52-2:55 - Victoria Modesta dances in a crowd of people symbolising 'technology' and sings 'I'm the prototype ', showing she wishes she could be like an actual cyborg. But there are also sequences where she retires her prosthetic body and rejoins the human race. At the same time, her prosthetic body more closely resembles the human form itself. This suggests that she is wavering in it, and it might be possible to judge that she is oscillating between returning to humans or entering a post-human state.

3:00-4:57 - "Provocatively, I deny your effort, I'm dedicated 'Cause I'm not restricted by your method, I ain't another project" after playing with the holders of traditional notions of humanity, Victoria Modesta is more determined to become one with technology, transcending limitations and challenging conventional notions of human identity.

5:00-6:06 - Victoria Modesta has entered an utterly post-human state. With it, the form of her prosthetic body and how she walks, abandoning the traditional paper and walk of the human body, represent a new level of transhumanist practice.

Modesta's work demonstrates that technology is not just a tool but a transformative force that can fundamentally change how we experience the world. Furthermore, it encourages an exploration of how the practices of transhumanism and the ideas of post-human theory intersect and inform each other to push the boundaries of what it means to be human.
