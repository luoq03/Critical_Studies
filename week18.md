# Week18-Write up a 'stupid' AI system.

Stupid AI I imagine a 'stupid' photo AI, which I'll call Stupid Photo AI (SPAI) below. SPAI has basic shooting functionality, but the timing, focus, and filters change randomly. In other words, SPAI may not work when people are ready to take a picture, but it will randomly take 'funny' images of people when they are relaxed. In addition, the SPAI will also randomly change focus etc., which may cause ghosting, distortion, blurring etc., of essential landscapes in the picture. Finally, SPAI's random stickers and filters may obscure important information in the image or completely change the scene's tone.

SPAI will be helpful for people trying to find inspiration in their lives or going out on a picnic to meet up with friends, turning taking photos into fun.

In addition to this, a camera that does not listen has the following advantages.

Unintentional art: Sometimes, a camera's disobedience can lead to unexpected but visually exciting results. For example, a camera with a malfunctioning shutter might produce blurry or distorted images that could be used as a starting point for artistic experimentation.

Unique perspectives: If a camera is not behaving as expected, getting creative with how you use it might be necessary. This could involve taking photos from unusual angles or experimenting with lighting conditions to compensate for the camera's shortcomings. The result could be a set of images that offer a unique perspective on a subject.

Improved problem-solving skills: Working with a disobedient camera can be frustrating but can also help you develop problem-solving skills. Experimenting with different settings and techniques, you can find workarounds to get the shots you need.

Increased patience: Dealing with a disobedient camera can be a test of patience, but it can also help you develop this valuable trait. As you work through the challenges presented by a problematic camera, you become more patient and better able to handle other types of setbacks in your life.

It is important to note that such Stupid AI needs to declare its features to the user before use, in particular the permission to take photos automatically and to stop authorising photos after exiting the app to prevent people's privacy from being compromised. In addition, this can lead to confusion and frustration about people's control over the technology, and users should be aware of the need to use it appropriately.
