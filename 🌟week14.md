# Week14-Coding Literacy

## What is literacy, and what does it mean to call computer programming literacy?

Literacy encompasses reading and writing and represents the essential skill of acquiring and applying knowledge. Before the advent of programming languages, when people knew characters and learned to accumulate them, they could pass on their knowledge through paper and pen. After writing and pen came printing technology, and since then, the range and possibilities of reading have been greatly enhanced. With the advent of programming languages, online communication became more widespread, information was more easily accessible, and programming languages broke down the barriers between different cultures even more. In a social context, literacy has preserved the continuity of civilisation and facilitated communication and integration between other regions and areas.

At the same time, programming languages act as the new literacy, thinking and creating in terms of computers, for example, developing different software or artificial intelligence. This may lead to people needing a programming base losing the possibility to access and distribute information through programming. To cater for this new way of processing and presenting information, developers will continue to create new programming languages, which will become more abstract and further expand the coverage of data and the functionality of each platform by programming languages. In the future, using a programming language will be easier for everyone than paper and pen today. As technology and software become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, programming will become ubiquitous, and this is the beauty of programming languages.

## The new thoughts :

'Computer programming is augmenting an already diverse array of communication skills important in everyday life. Because of the computer's primary role in all digital literacies, programming's augmentation of literacy funda mentally reconfigures it. The computer's primary role in all digital literacies and programming's augmentation of literacy funds mentally reconfigures it. Literacy becomes much larger, and the relationships and practices it characterises change as it grows. When literacy includes coding, the ways we experience, teach, and move with our skills, social paradigms, communication technologies, and information all shift.'

The author highlights that programming is about to become a more widely held and universally helpful skill, with code reading and writing as a new socially valued knowledge that reflects society's perception of necessary and good skills. This makes me feel proud and, simultaneously, wonder whether it is creating a new barrier to knowledge, thus giving rise to 'computer illiteracy' in a new context. The global availability of computer languages will better ensure that people at lower income levels are protected from employment and economic problems caused by their 'computer illiteracy' status. However, it is also still being determined whether coders can take control of economic and cultural development and whether people's private information will be violated as a result.

'Live coding is an open-ended performative process that rejects deterministic or previously held certainties over how meanings are generated and disseminated.'

In the book, the authors emphasise the random and subjective nature of real-time coding and how it works. The audience's participation needs to be clearly defined. Still, the coding skills of the audience need to be clearly defined, which may or may not create technical barriers or make it less entertaining. At the same time, it will test the resilience and ethics of the live coders even more.

The moment that made me understand his position was when he asked people in the room, 'why do people who are not professional writers need to learn to read and writeâ€˜. Programming languages exist not as a way to get a job or make money but as one of the most creative development tools that will affect people's social lives shortly. Unfortunately, we have yet to discover it.
Two points that inspired me to think were.

Apart from reducing the financial cost and difficulty of learning programming languages, the most important thing is to create the motivation and opportunity for people to learn programming languages and how to make it a smooth and painless learning process.
What surprised me the most was the way he substituted the programming display into the performance, which I admit is efficient, easy to modify, and easy for others to pick up and recreate. But it also makes it difficult for people who need to learn the programming language to break out of the programming routine that comes with the code, which creates a creative barrier for artists with low coding skills.
