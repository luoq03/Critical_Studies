# Week15-Gallery/Museum Visit

This week we visited the South London Gallery, located around the school. We noticed the most visible art installation in the venue, 'IRL (In Real Life)', and the artist who created it, Katie Surridge.

Katie Surridge is a contemporary British artist who explores themes of identity, technology and the relationship between the physical and virtual worlds. In her work, she often incorporates digital media, including video, animation and interactive installations, to create immersive experiences that engage viewers in conversations about the impact of technology on our lives.

Her work "IRL (In Real Life)" (2021) is a multimedia installation that explores the concept of digital identity and its relationship to physical space. The structure consists of a large projection of a virtual landscape that the viewer can interact with using a custom-designed mobile application. Through the app, the viewer can navigate the virtual space, manipulate the environment and interact with virtual objects, thus bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds.

The themes Surridge explores in her work are particularly relevant to today's society, where our lives are increasingly influenced by technology. By blurring the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds, she invites viewers to question their relationship with technology and to consider its impact on their sense of self and identity.

One of the most intriguing elements of Surridge's work is how she seamlessly integrates different forms of media to create an immersive and engaging experience. Her installations often combine sculpture, video and interactive technology elements to create a multi-sensory experience that draws the viewer into her world.

Regarding suggestions for her subsequent work, it would be interesting to see Surridge continue to explore themes of identity and technology by incorporating new forms of technology or experimenting with different modes of interaction. Her work could also benefit from further interaction with audiences through workshops or other activities that encourage active participation in the art-making process.

Overall, Surridge's work demonstrates how art can engage with and comment on contemporary societal issues. Her exploration of the relationship between technology and identity is thought-provoking and stunning. It inspires other artists to incorporate these essential themes in their work.
