## **Exploring the Intersection of Technology and Human Expression: A Study of 'The Treachery of Sanctuary'---Yiren Wang**

This review offers a comprehensive and insightful analysis of Chris Milk's Betrayal of Sanctuary and its exploration of the intersection between technology and human expression. The author begins by describing the artwork and its use of motion sensors to capture the viewer's silhouette and transform it into the image of a bird, blurring the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds. The author then highlights how the work challenges the traditional boundaries between art, technology and the viewer, inviting the viewer to reflect on the potential of technology to enhance and expand our understanding of the natural world.

The author draws comparisons with another interactive work by Golan Levin, "Assemblage", which explores the potential of technology to create a personalised and immersive experience for the viewer. Through this comparison, the author highlights the unique and engaging quality of interactive and immersive art, which produces an experience that cannot be replicated in any other way. Furthermore, the author reflects on what makes interactive and immersive art interesting.

Finally, the author offers a perspective on the influence and potential of combining human expression, nature and technology in art. The authors highlight the exciting question of whether nature creates man or man creates character, and the potential of artistic expression to merge these elements in new and exciting ways.

Overall, the assessment shows a deep understanding of the subject and reflects on the role of technology in enhancing human expression and our relationship with nature.

## **The design museum---Xinyue Zhao**

The author experiences two distinct design narratives in two exhibitions at the Design Museum, Designer-Maker-User and Objects of Desire, and concludes that curators rely on different records to shape people's understanding of their subject matter. The importance of curation in shaping people's version of the subject matter is highlighted.

The authors argue that in Designer-Maker-User, the exhibition focuses on design's functional and commercial aspects, emphasising standardisation and user experience. In contrast, Objects of Desire explores the influence of surrealist thinking on innovation, rejecting rational and logical constraints and exploring the world of the subconscious and irrational.

On the other hand, the author seeks to remind us of the need to look critically at the structures of knowledge in the exhibition. Power dynamics in society manifest themselves in various forms and can be observed in different aspects of social, political, economic and cultural life. Cultural institutions such as museums, galleries and media organisations play a crucial role in shaping social narratives and values through curation and media communication, which can reinforce or challenge existing power dynamics.

Overall, the authors provide thought-provoking insights into the Design Museum's exhibition, giving us an insight into the importance of curation in shaping people's understanding of design and the need to think critically when looking at the narratives presented in the exhibition.

## **Low tech web---Pinsi Wang**

The article discusses the increasing energy consumption of data centres in the face of increased demand for real-time availability of networks and servers, which harms the environment. In response, the authors highlight the advantages of low-tech sites, which are also web pages that can operate self-sustainably and better protect the environment due to their small size and the use of solar servers.
The authors explain the principles and features of the first technology website, such as how it reduces data bandwidth and energy consumption. The effectiveness of low-tech websites in reducing energy consumption and raising environmental awareness is analyzed. More importantly, it can reduce dependence on third-party data centre bandwidth maintenance.
At the end of the article, the authors emphasize that low-tech websites may only be suitable for some industries and companies. Still, the concept of environmental protection and its sustainability should be advocated.
