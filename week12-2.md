## A little story

On a space station orbiting a distant planet, a father and daughter duo of aliens had made a home for themselves. They had traveled through the galaxy searching for a place where they could live without fear of being erased or excluded because of their differences. They had finally found it on this space station, where crip technoscience was the norm.
The technology on the space station was designed to accommodate and celebrate difference. Instead of eliminating disability, it was integrated into the station's design, making it a place where all abilities could thrive. For example, the floors of the station were designed with different textures and colors to accommodate those with visual impairments or mobility issues. The station's AI system was programmed to recognize and respond to various communication styles and languages.
The crew on the space station was selected based on a rigorous process that valued diversity and inclusion. The selection process was designed to recognize the value of different life experiences and perspectives. The father and daughter were selected based on their unique abilities and contributions to their community on their previous planet.
However, their life on the space station was not always peaceful. One day, they received a distress signal from a spacecraft that had been hijacked by a group of space pirates. The father and daughter knew that they had to help, even if it meant putting their own lives at risk.
As they approached the spacecraft, they realized that the captain had betrayed his own crew and had joined forces with the pirates. The father and daughter knew they had to act fast. Using their unique abilities, they infiltrated the ship and managed to take control of its systems.
They worked tirelessly to free the crew and take down the pirates. Their efforts were successful, and they managed to save the lives of everyone on board the hijacked spacecraft. Their actions were celebrated on the space station, and they were hailed as heroes.
The father and daughter knew that their unique abilities had played a critical role in saving the lives of the crew. They also knew that their experience as disabled individuals had allowed them to see the situation from a different perspective and to come up with innovative solutions.
Their actions highlighted the importance of valuing diversity and difference in all aspects of life, including space exploration. They continued to work on the space station, using their unique abilities and experiences to improve the lives of everyone on board.
The father and daughter knew that they had found a place where their differences were not only accepted but celebrated. They were grateful to have found a community that recognized the value of all abilities and perspectives. They knew that their journey through the galaxy had led them to a place where they could finally call home.
